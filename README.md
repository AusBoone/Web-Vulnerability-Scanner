# Web-Vulnerability-Scanner
This project is a Web Vulnerability Scanner that aims to identify common security vulnerabilities in web applications. The scanner first crawls a target website, builds a site map, and then checks for various security issues, such as XSS, SQL injection, SSRF, IDOR, and common misconfigurations.

# Features
- Crawls a target website, extracting internal links and forms.
- Scans for common web application vulnerabilities:
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- SQL Injection
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- Checks for common security misconfigurations:
- Unnecessary open ports
- Default or missing security headers
- Default credentials
- Supports rate-limiting and follows robots.txt rules.
- Uses multithreading to improve crawling performance.
- Provides logging and report generation.

# Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Install required packages using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
1) Update the config.json file with your desired crawl delay (in seconds).
2) Run the scanner using the following command:
python main.py <target_url> <known_user_id>
Replace <target_url> with the URL of the website you want to scan and <known_user_id> with a known user ID for IDOR testing.
3) After the scanner has finished, review the scan.log file for any logging information and the report.txt file for a summary of identified vulnerabilities.
